 U10_the_loyal_pack_title:0 "The Loyal Pack"
 U10_the_loyal_pack_desc:0 "Before Brrtekuh became our leader, we were mere squabbling packs fighting for scrap of good land amidst the desolate land. Unlike other leaders before her, she wasn’t fueled by mere greed or bloodlust but by a scheme beyond mortal understanding, her actions as if it was part of the greater plan. Everything was taken into account, even this upsetting catastrophe, the pack only needed to heed the order of her commanders and the rest of the scheme would fall into place."
 U10_return_of_the_queen_title:0 "Return of the Queen"
 U10_return_of_the_queen_desc:0 "The humans looked down on us, saw us as nothing more than mere delusional gnolls barely keeping attention to, but our resurgence draws near."

 U10_second_wind_desc:0 "When the Splitter of Sands managed to rally the gnolls of the Western Krahway, whether it be squabbling tribesmen, Irkorzik exiles or Seascourge refugees, all of us were in awe of her splendor and knew in each of our hearts that her birthright extended from the seas to beyond the sand dunes. Many of our own kind called us crazy, delusional, brainwashed and idiotic for serving what they see as a glorified corpse. But as true believers of Kvanga, we know that death is but the beginning of life. In the last decade, we have spent our time tirelessly finding a way to cure her ailment. Through much trial and error, the Vog Mekza believed that they could, with the proper men and resources, be able to strengthen Brrtekuh’s soul with those of others."
 U10_makeshift_navy_title:0 "Makeshift Navy"
 U10_makeshift_navy_desc:0 "Our alliance with the Seascourge pack was one born out of mutual interests, to safeguard gnoll-kind from getting overwhelmed by the human hunting us, to surround the weak human kingdom then split the spoil, but the most important of all was to share our knowledge. The Viaakoc were more familiar with the vast sea of Divenhal and us Brrtekuh have subdued the desert with network of bulwark we have built across it, with our pact finally earning a coastline, we shall voraciously study the design of our enemy’s sunken vessels and absorb their essence into our fledgling navy."

 U10_consume_the_king_desc:0 "The guards who failed their duty and ambushed Brrtekuh were hailed heroes among the Deshaki, despite their past success in their career, they found employment at the court of Eborthil. The Eborthil think they can have anyone as their royal guards as long as their so-called impenetrable fortress stands. This arrogance shall not stand! We shall strike our claws into the stone and tear it brick by brick, until our claws and fangs touch the body of the one that struck Brrtekuh, then we shall unleash our full might and paint the royal hall with the blood of the dishonorable cowards who rendered our leader to the sorry state she was forced to endure!"
 U10_splitting_the_sands_title:0 "Splitting the Sands"
 U10_splitting_the_sands_desc:0 "While we were slaving way, scraping by for any sort of sustenance in the desert forsaken by the gods, our fellow gnollkind to the south grew ever more delusional by its false grandeur and they seek to expand it, live with it no matter the death and destruction it causes.\n The golden sands may be beautiful, but it is a lifeless one that seeks to extinguish the cycle of life and death, without ever giving it the chance to rebound. This is an affront to Kvanga herself, we must show our fellow siblings in faith the truth before it is too late."
 U10_thief_of_torrents_title:0 "Thief of Torrents"
 U10_thief_of_torrents_desc:0 "The desert is a cruel place, scorching at sunrise and freezing after sunset, but yet there are still fleeting resistances of life between the shifting dunes. Many have been snuffed out by the desert, wasting their potential. But us faithful shall protect them from the harsh heat and sandstorms, giving them a chance to be so much more, a small step in taming the Salahad."
 U10_butchers_of_chains_title:0 "Butchers of Chains"
 U10_butchers_of_chains_desc:0 "The Kheteratans exploited our grief and chained us to servitude in a twisted mockery of nature, but naturally it was only time for such a heinous deed. Bound to the land unwanted by the humans and left to decay when poor Brrtekuh was hurt and unable to resume her campaign, that’s what they wanted to believe! Brrtekuh trusted us to lead the pack in her stead, and now we have broken free. Now it is time to show the human and arrogant Khet why it was foolish to leave us alive."
 U10_prepare_the_pack_title:0 "Prepare the Pack"
 U10_prepare_the_pack_desc:0 "The humiliation suffered from our last battle was servere, not only did we lose our queen’s wisdom, a large part of our pack sacrificed themselves to save Brrtekuh from the human who attempted to slaughter our pack during our most vulnerable moment. Many of whom have their remains scattered across the desert, condemned to never be with their family through the ritual of the death that we so yearned for. Even worse was those unfortunate few whose skeleton was snatched by a cowardly human who defiled them by decorating their house with our bretheren’s skull. While their soul may never be with the pack, they may roam the earth with the grin on their face when we rid the land of their tormentor and proclaim our primacy for a great destiny awaits!"
 U10_zerv_zamenx_title:0 "Zerv Zamenx"
 U10_zerv_zamenx_desc:0 "We are not demons, we are creatures of virtue molded by Kvanga. The foolish sun elves would never understand this, to them, we are merely a continuation of centuries of xhazobkultist tyranny. If they truly believe they are worthy enough to name themselves after the sun itself, then let us bring a force of a thousand flames onto their land and see how they fare!"

 U10_beneath_the_sands_desc:0 "Kheterata, land of mythical yet very beings known as Khet. It is said that they possess power only dwarfed by dragons. Surely, by consuming a Khet, we can understand more of the secrets of their power. However, we understand it is unwise to confront a Khet, let alone a whole castle of them head on. Instead, we have turned to rumors of long lost pyramids buried by the dunes of the desert, containing mummified bodies of dead khets.The Khets and Kheteratan will not be pleased with us despoiling the graves of their gods, so we must be discrete."
 U10_an_offer_of_freedom_title:0 "An Offer of Freedom"
 U10_an_offer_of_freedom_desc:0 "Deshak taught us that humans are wild, cruel and unruly not too unlike our ancestral spirits that Kvanga reforged into the first gnolls long ago. As the race crafted and meticulously created by the goddess in her loving image, naturally, we have inherited this mission of hers, acting as benevolent guides to these lost souls, turning them into beings capable of understanding virtue like us. And yet, we must remind ourselves to keep a firm hand on them, afterall, all well-crafted tools are first drenched in flames."
 U10_riches_of_deshak_title:0 "Riches of Deshak"
 U10_riches_of_deshak_desc:0 "It was no mistake that Brrtekuh chose Deshak as the first target of her grand conquest. A weak land rich of metals and weak humans worshipping a twisted version of Kvanga, desperately needing true guidance. We have shown them that Eborthil will never fufill this role, only us. But all debts must be paid and they must pay theirs to repent for their sins against our pack."
 U10_collaborative_protection_title:0 "Collaborative Protection"
 U10_collaborative_protection_desc:0 "The gnomes are exemplary of the virtue of innovativeness preached by the Vog Mekza, though currently they are wasting their efforts on serving the decadent Khet, we can reforge them and convince them of our ways. In due time, they could become an integral part of helping us with managing and constructing our realm."
 U10_bureau_of_archeology_title:0 "Bureau of Archeology"
 U10_bureau_of_archeology_desc:0 "Our collaborations with the gnomes have opened up a library of knowledge regarding Kheteratan history.

 U10_bulwarks_against_bulwar_desc:0 "The ash of Phoenix Empire scattered across Bulwar, setting fire to many realms in Bulwar. Demagogue of Dead God, Glory-seeking Elves and Our corrupted cousin ran amok causing chaos in that cursed land. It may be a wise decision to erect citadels along the border to contain the chaos, giving us breathing room to focus on more urgent matters elsewhere."
 U10_commence_the_endgame_title:0 "Commence the Endgame"
 U10_commence_the_endgame_desc:0 "The Kheteratans are truly a lost people, they mock us as blind for our devotion to our disabled pack mistress, and yet they themselves mindlessly and blissfully slave away to the exploitation of unindustrious and wasteful creatures disguising themselves as gods, themselves unaware of their impending doom. Ever since we killed our first Khet, we have prepared special task forces in key locations containing the khet, ready at a moment’s notice to execute the khets that reside within our borders. Today, we shall commence the vanquishing of these false pretenders of divinity."
 U10_finale_of_eternity_title:0 "Finale of Eternity"
 U10_finale_of_eternity_desc:0 "The Khets thought they could escape, but they too are cursed like us, ever bound to the Sorrow. It was only a matter of time before our vigilant armies reached the last of their holdings along the damned river. With the entirety of the Khet under our grasp, finally, we can end this wretched, prideful and pitiful creature who has only known decadence within their long life once and for all. Casting their souls into the flames of purification and then our maws to ensure their souls can be repurposed for a greater purpose, to strengthen the rule of Brrtekuh and all the greats that shall succeed her."

At the same time, many merchants north of Deshak are profiteering off our lands, competing with our own honest merchants to amass their own wealth. By collaborating with the corsairs, we could secure trade for ourselves by harassing their trade ships."
 U10_purification_title:0 "Purification"
 U10_purification_desc:0 "Our nation plagued by the vengeful souls of Khets ever resentful, the Sorrow bleeding from a mother who weeps blood for her ill-bred children. In the midst of these conditions, great shamans from all over our realm have studied the curse as well as that of purifying the dead. They have told us of 4 difficult tasks, requiring us to accumulate a variety of resources from across the horizons to dehex the powerful curses that plagues our nation."

Brrtekuh showed us that loyalty matters more than any proving battle, it is time we prove to our fellow packmates that we have truly inherited her soul and recreate the pack to serve out of loyalty and respect, not simply out of fear or dominance."
 U10_proof_of_the_soul_within_desc:0 "Many still question our beliefs in endocannibalism, those who have strayed from the faith and tempted by demons. In order to correct this issue, the presence of the Vog Mekza must be extended to every corner of the realm and ensure unity."

Of course, we truly care for them as fellow gnolls, it is only natural but they have far too long been following a misguided path guided by their basest wild instincts.

But today, this ends now, with the Ndurubu deadset on our extermination from Kvanga’s Earth defeated and thoroughly subjugated, this marks the day of a new Gnollish unity, proving to each of us that we are not separate tribes, but one united under by the destiny of Brrtekuh against a world full of enemies."

 U10_integrate_corsair_codes_desc:0 "Though violent, disorderly and oftentimes brazen, the corsairs of the Divenhal that we have been sponsoring have been growing ever more powerful and as such required codified practices to keep their privateering fleets and crewmates in line. Some of these ‘corsair codes’, as many have called them, are surprisingly well structured and republican. If we adopt this wayfaring knowledge and apply it to our own republic, we will surely benefit"

 U10_centralize_the_western_sect_desc:0 "Due to the many unorganized tribes isolated by the desert, the Way of Bone contains often differing tenets unlike the more unified Way of Iron of the fieldstalkers. This is the origin of the conflicting beliefs that led to the schism of beliefs between Brrtekuh and Irkorzik, dividing two nations that worship the same god. With our grasp over the gnolls of the west secured, we can correct the many mistakes of the packs, ensuring that we shall never again be divided against foreign threats."

The first is that three loyal advisors offered their bodies to Brrtekuh; their sacrifice was so powerful and moving that it restored her to health. Restored, she spoke eloquently about what needed to be done, praised the council, and explained how Kvanga had warned her that the Khets were Demons and must be destroyed. Then, she returned to her sleep, satisfied that her pack was in good hands.\n\nThe other version was that the advisors, who may not have volunteered, were drawn to the Headquarters with different intentions. Their corpses were cut into smaller pieces and thrown into a meat grinder until they were a paste. That meat paste was given to Brrtekuh through a funnel. She didn’t speak eloquently or have any notion of what was happening; what happened was that a finger started to lift, then another. Soon, her left hand moved, and her eyes no longer stared into the distance but focused on their surroundings. A map was brought, and the council spent hours explaining what had happened and the pack's state. After it had finished, Brrtekuh made two repeated signals with her hand: one for the Khets and the other for the Demons. The Council inferred that this meant that the Khets were Demons and should be punished for their wickedness.\n\nOne of these versions is the truth, and the other is a lie, but which one do you think the people believe in?"

Still, for the executioner, who killed all of them and then proceeded to "process" the bodies for consumption, it wasn’t their first time, nor would it be the last. They did their job with no rage or passion, used to the butchering and execution of so many, this day would be remembered by all of Eborthilians with deep regret and promises of revenge. The Deshaks had a sense of dread for the rise of another gnoll enemy and of the royal family they lost. For the gnolls, a day of celebration and laughter over how they had avenged a wrong, the destruction of those who dared to hurt their Brrtekuh. But for the executioner....."

This trek was different from the usual however, bringing those same gnolls who have mythologized the endlessly engulfing desert, along with their pack mistress. Now with [F69.Monarch.GetTitle] [F69.Monarch.GetName] before us, there is no dispute on which of the two sister packs of the western sands is the greatest."

The accused were escorted to the desert and were forced to march, day upon day, with no food or water. As they died, their bodies were abandoned, their meat or blood left to waste, the greatest shame that could happen to a member of the faith, meaning that their remains were not worth being recycled and used anew. This proceeded till all were gone; it wasn’t the end of the punishment. Their names were crossed from the written record, and their families were prohibited from honouring or mentioning them. A Gnoll dies twice, first when they stop breathing and a second time, when somebody says their name for the last time.\n\nStill a question remain, what to do in relation to the rest of the clergy? They were involved in the rebellion, but some claim that they were manipulated, others that they have seen the error of their ways, the council is faced a choice, use those left to reform the system or continue the executions"

The excavators were greeted with a cold gust alien to the scorching heat that they had been whooping to escape just a few minutes ago, yet many hesitate to venture further down the hatch which only holds the ashes of torches dotted orderly on the walls. The silence of the pyramid then consumed the archeologists for a while until one brave gnoll volunteered to light the way for the rest.\n\nAs the makeshift expedition ventured deeper into the temple, more and more cat motifs appeared alongside texts of ancient Kheteratan. Though the language has many distinctions compared to its modern variant. They managed to deduce that this temple indeed treasures the remains of a khet who ventured too far from Kheterata Proper and killed itself, though there seems to be other texts surrounding these scriptures, written in an unknown language completely alien to the Kheteratan script, the party concludes that it is probably nothing too important and moved on.\n\nEventually, they reached a large room, oddly simple and humble for the tomb of a khet, yet there it was, a large sarcophagus that is undeniably housing something which is bigger than both gnolls and humans. The party cheered in joy for the boon, though they were immediately overshadowed by a loud hiss causing the party to loudly yelp and scramble out of the pyramid to report their findings."

The Khet opened his palm and let the sand flow faster and faster until it overwhelmed everything around it, a death by a thousand cuts; it was inevitable.\n\nYet the Gnoll refused death. For the Khet, this was an affront. How did this overgrown Hyena dare to stand? Any other creature would have fallen, had to fall.\n\nYet again, the Gnoll dared, step by step, to approach the Khet, so the Khet increased its power. The wind got more viscous, and sand flew so quickly that it could cut iron. The Gnoll would yield...\n\nThe Gnoll refused, and for the first time in a millennium, the Khet knew rage; the sandstorm grew in size and ferocity, and nothing could survive. The Gnoll was dead, thought the Khet, it was inevitable.\n\nYet from the sandstorm, a dagger appeared and did the impossible: It cut through the skin of Khet's neck, making it perhaps for the first time in its long life to cry out in anguish. For a creature that had lived so long, it died very quickly, bleeding in the water of Sorrow."
