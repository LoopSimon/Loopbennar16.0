 flavour_grasshopper_muncher.1.d:0 "Even back in the ancestral caverns of the Serpentspine, goblins have been enslaved and tormented by orcs for as long as anyone can remember. When the Greentide started, the orcs forced us into clans to fulfill certain roles. While other clans such as clan Earworm received easier tasks, we were granted no such mercy. Sent to the frontlines with nothing but our clothes to shield us, we marched into arrow volleys and absorbed charges so that our orcish masters could save themselves. We were fed nothing but bugs. We feared this fate would only end when the last of us perished.\n\nAnd then Korgus died. With the orcs rushing back from Castonath in retreat, we managed to hole ourselves up in Taranton. Our chief, Zurgab, set up our defenses and prepared us for the first battle fighting for our own survival against a group of rogue adventurers known as the Oathbreakers. The Oathbreakers were a small band of opportunists with only one goal: looting as much as they could from the ruin of Escann and heading back home to enjoy their new wealth.\n\nThe Battle of Survival almost resulted in a catastrophe. Adventurers tore through our goblin fighters like they were nothing. Zurgab fought ferociously, but in the end he was outnumbered and decapitated by a particularly bulky human.\n\nGramzik, only eleven winters old, witnessed the fall of his father with his own eyes and saw only red. He picked up the impromptu spear he had crafted from a tree branch before the battle. When the slayer of his father turned to him, Gramzik jammed the branch into the visor, managing to push the makeshift spear deep into his skull. The murderer could not even muster a gurgle before dying.\n\nAt the end of the fight, five humans had found their ultimate fate by Gramzik’s hands. The Oathbreakers may have been defeated for the moment, but it was clear that the Grasshopper Munchers were left to die in this territory, surrounded by hostile adventurers and with the rival Rotcleaver clan unwilling to come to their aid. Yet Gramzik’s daring gave everyone a modicum of hope. Despite the odds, a little goblin like him could win a fight against a superior foe. Perhaps, even the clan of expendable Grasshopper Munchers could then defeat the adventurers around them. And maybe one distant day, it would be goblins telling the humans and orcs what to do.\n\nAs our warriors and clan elders swore loyalty to young Gramzik, his eyes were focused on Taranton. It was here where they’d make their stand against all enemies and it was here where goblins would finally build their true home."
