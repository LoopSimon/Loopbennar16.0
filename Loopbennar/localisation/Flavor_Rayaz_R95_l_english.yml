 rayaz_1_1_title:0 "It Goes In The Family"
 rayaz_1_1_desc:0 "Katyradz was always a lively person. Between me, Ayralgaz and him, he was always the most passionate and confident if not a tad bit brash. And I consider that probably because of that overconfidence, the Naga decided to not be as supportive of him as of me. Perhaps because he could stand on his own with less resources. Maybe as a way to temper his spirit, so he doesn’t become blinded with success, or even grows more dependent on them. \nWhatever the reason is, he has indeed succeeded in his small endeavor as a sellsword to the Karasskas, keeping the human frontier under control and finally rising up against his employers, sneakily capturing the broken spire in the process. Even if I do not have the ability to fully support his venture right now, I want to help him as much as I can. Collapse of Karassk would benefit pretty much everyone involved and his failure in doing so would be a missed opportunity to get rid of a major pretender to my title. And above all - can’t let my sibling embarrass himself in front of the entire continent." 

 rayaz_1_2_title:0 "Crushed Dreams"
 rayaz_1_2_desc:0 "Ever since the Hail of Black Needles, Karassk became a pariah city for the Naga. It was no surprise to anyone that destroying part of a spire would inevitably lead to denouncing their leaders as despoilers unworthy of bringing the final empire, or any empire at that. Yet, to this day, it is also one of the most powerful states of Taneyas, throwing around their fortune on mercenaries to do their bidding, which in the case of my brother could end their sovereignty once and for all.\nAs much as I cheer for his success, I cannot imagine his autonomy lasting long after this struggle is finished. In his victory, he shall gain power too large to go unchecked for the Naga, as they will immediately seek to undermine him and bring what he has earned to my knees. I could try to give him other stations to appease him, but knowing how he always liked to do things “his way”, he will likely reject whatever I give to him.\n\nI imagine it shall be even worse if he loses. A victorious Karassk would remain hard to conquer, large enough to threaten every campaign I could go for and annoyingly slow to crumble on its own, greatly limiting my ability to prioritize other fronts that are much more prestigious than this husk of a great power. \n\nI can only hope that whatever happens, it will only make things easier for us."

 rayaz_1_3_title:0 "Suffer No Interlopers"
 rayaz_1_3_desc:0 "After the entire western border is solidified under the Rayaz banner, I will be solely responsible to defend us from the threats that await there. The human hordes, abusing the failures of Anzara, have been poking and prodding at the lizardfolk frontier for hundreds of years, slowly pushing us away from our settlements, daring to raid through the vastness of the jungle right into the heart of Taneyas. Even now, various smoothskin smugglers in our markets appear on a daily basis, circumventing whatever restrictions we want to impose on them.\nBeing born as the Riverclaw, I know the terrain of this area and the places where these unwanted expeditions go through. Those spots need to be fortified and patrolled, so that no foreign party can slip through without our knowledge. We also need to make a navy to patrol the newly acquired waters, one that does not consist solely of the vessels taken from merchants, unadapted to war conditions. We need fast vessels that can board the smugglers’ ships effectively and stop them from escaping into the open sea unspotted.\nIf that can be managed, we will finally be able to enforce our own terms on this border and no Nyokyora, Aakhet or any other smoothskin warlord will enter Taneyas to spoil themselves with our riches."

 rayaz_2_1_title:0 "Legacy of Past War"
 rayaz_2_1_desc:0 "My first war against Zerat has been quite a lesson for me. It showed me why their cities are large, their coffers bountiful and their armies disciplined. Their administration is simply superior to ours in almost every way. They have a proper chain of command, we don’t. They have supply chains, while we ravage the countryside to feed the warbands. They have proper elite regiments with quality training and the best greatmaw steeds money can provide, we pulled farm animals to serve for cavalrymen. These reasons, among many others, are why they were able to hold out against what should be an overwhelming amount of troops.\nI’ve been devising a plan to implement some of their methods to transform our tribal warband into a more organised entity with a more defined hierarchy and clear responsibilities. While it may not be received warmly across all fronts, it is pretty apparent that a change was needed for us to prevent needless bloodshed. It won’t make us even across all fronts, but it is a good beginning for a larger initiative, once we have the most immediate threats under our control."

 rayaz_2_3_title:0 "Triumph of the Green Party"
 rayaz_2_3_desc:0 "Khugra is a silent battlefield. Most of their ruling class, beset by some kind of a mad inferiority complex, never desired their independence, relying on Karassk to take care of them. Now that they’ve been abandoned by them, the city elites bicker over who gets to be their next protector. Rayaz is but one of those powers and out of all parties interested in carving the city’s domain we are ones who would benefit the most in controlling the mouth of Adzalas. \nWith the most imminent threats dealt with, I can finally put focus here and try to seize what I would deem as a once in a lifetime opportunity. The profits that could be gained from controlling the Jewel of Adzalas cannot be understated, but with the addition of a friendly ruling class, that is more than willing to be my subject… What else can I really ask for?"

 rayaz_2_4_title:0 "Secrets of Crater City"
 rayaz_2_4_desc:0 "Normally, Karshyr would be a relatively unimpressive port, eclipsed through centuries of mismanagement from their Karassian overlords, making it a place that I wouldn’t be interested in. \nMy Naga advisors though… they have taken a particular curiosity about this, baffled about lack of their kin in the islands’ native population. They talk about the rich history of its capital, placed in a dormant volcano as a supposedly good location to hide away powerful secrets. \nIndeed, Karshyras historians are renowned for their diligence in record-keeping, as their vaults can only be compared to those in Shangra, far at the other edge of Taneyas. Perhaps their knowledge could help me find a reason to silence the most reverent, that Karassk was never in a place to be called the Final Empire. And who knows, maybe their knowledge can lead me into some more interesting discoveries..."

 rayaz_3_2_title:0 "Fall of the Godchosen"
 rayaz_3_2_desc:0 "The Scaleguards have proven to be a tough enemy for me. Even at the face of imminent defeat, they still indulge in their lavish lifestyle and delusional propaganda, while bribing my tribesmen to secure a little more time to prepare their defense. \nBut their time has come. They have failed lizardfolk multiple times across this era. It was their bickering that led to Ashhana and humans ravaging Taneyas far and wide. It was during their reign that lizardfolk lost two spires to foreigners. It has been clear for a long time that their mandate to rule over lizardfolk is over and I am here because the gods that have chosen them, have given me the mandate to finish them once and for all.\nWe will bring down their legacy once and for all, humiliate the city that housed their leeching behavior for so long. Portraits depicting their debauchery will be tarnished. [L69.Monarch.GetName], along with his entire court, executed. What is left of their estate, spread across the country to improve the lives of commonfolk. Their example will give a clear message for everyone.\nThere will be no place for greed, decadence and corruption in the Final Empire."

 rayaz_3_3_title:0 "Replace the Decadent City"
 rayaz_3_3_desc:0 "I can tell of many wrongdoings that Anzara brought upon its citizens. I can tell of their mismanagement, stubbornness and pride, but in that selfishness they still served an important and perhaps these days forgotten function - patronage of arts. \nIndeed, the Scaleguards have been telling their part of the story about me for years. I’ve been talking to the few that had the courage to accept my invitation or invite me themselves and they’ve shown me what my image is here in clear words. \nThat I am a “warmonger from the jungles”, no less intelligent than a Blood-indulging Ashhana, with no desire for cultural fulfillment, but rather relish in looting their works to fuel my next campaigns. Now that I’ve taken over their place as sovereign, many artists fear that their careers and perhaps lives may be brought to an abrupt end.\nThey are wrong. I have plans to revitalize this land precisely to empower those artistically gifted. I will provide them with fresh resources from around my domain from the markets of Rayazas. New schools and temples will replace those looted by my comrades. Cities will be founded to make house for new generations. In short, lands around Lake Lasadza will become a bustling centre of new lizardfolk culture, one free to roam beyond the visages and hunts of the Anzaran royal family, embracing the new future under the prophecy."

 rayaz_3_4_title:0 "Clouded Mind Obscures Stars"
 rayaz_3_4_desc:0 "The citizens of Nazhni have recently taken a liking towards a dangerous lifestyle, spreading their Nazhyn weed in a dried form that when smoked supposedly frees the mind and relaxes the body. Normally, it would be a perfectly fair endeavor, that we would encourage as we’d do with every medicinal herb, but my advisors have noticed a particular thing about this drug. They’ve noticed that clients of Nazhni have taken a particularly toxic relationship with this good, buying more and more of it in greater amounts, amassing great debts to their merchants and thus binding them to their will. \nI have indulged in it as well and sadly it seems that they might be right. Despite the quality time you can get by using the weed and the freedom from stress it provided me, I’ve found to crave it more, even obsessively over time. I… I can only imagine what they can demand from the people they do not fear. It simply has to be stopped. I cannot let my people and myself be enslaved in such a horrible way."

 rayaz_3_5_title:0 "As It Was Foretold"
 rayaz_3_5_desc:0 "The purpose of my life, fulfilled at last..."

 rayaz_4_1_title:0 "Those Who Come To Us..."
 rayaz_4_1_desc:0 "My state is not one where a single tribe dominates over the other, subjugated subjects. Most of our partners are here with us willfully because they share a similar motivation in bringing forth the foretold empire, wisely preferring to stand as the tip of the spear instead of being on its receiving end. Their continued compliance with us is a testament of our effectiveness and a mark that my cause is just and its result inevitable. \nYet on our borders and beyond, there are still those who were either too far or skeptical of the news about tribes dismissing petty grudges in favor of something greater. If they cannot be persuaded to join me directly, they can help me in other ways. Even something as simple as good word of mouth can prove crucial for the legitimacy of my claim and so my relations with these communities have to only become warmer as the time goes on. \nAt some point, reasons for their separation will become irrelevant, eclipsed by the growing benefits of uniting under my banner. We only need to prepare to open our arms and welcome them."

 rayaz_4_2_title:0 "...I Am Responsible For"
 rayaz_4_2_desc:0 "If my legacy is to be eternal, I cannot just garner everything to myself. The support of my allies and successes of ours give us enormous resources that we can use in much better ways, than emulating the rich cities' overflowing treasuries. Their way is the way of losing all support once there is no gain to be had. Unsustainable.\nLoyalty is a value that needs to be nourished through acts of unprompted kindness. As the community gives to me, I have to give back to them like a good ruler does. As of now, I have an overabundance of men that served me well in previous wars. I will allow them to come back to their communities, serving in my name for the public cause, building roads, houses, performing all of the hard tasks that experience in my warband can help with."

 rayaz_4_3_title:0 "Chieftain of All Tribes"
 rayaz_4_3_desc:0 "Most of the emperors recorded in history have hailed themselves from the ancient cities, often lost to history. These metropoli have provided them with vast resources to manage right from the start. \nThis makes our ascension even more special. I have started this journey with one measly tribe and worked my way up with the blessing of the Naga. I hail from the poor, scattered, dumb Arraskay, neglected by numerous empires and their successors alike. I grew in the measly conditions that cause us all to put each other’s throats and I know that we deserve better. An education, to showcase our talents. Partners that we can trust in common ventures. Respect of the cityfolk, who always treated us as lessers. That is my will as the Chieftain Emperor and I can only reach it with every tribe following my trail.\nSo we must unite. The integrity of the Final Empire cannot be based on a system, where everyone gets their own set of laws and autonomy, chaotically changing customs inbetween murky borders. One massive army to protect every corner of Taneyas. One massive budget for the projects that will connect every community with each other. And a Chieftain Emperor to lead them."

 rayaz_5_1_title:0 "...And Those Who Defy Us"
 rayaz_5_1_desc:0 "The Ashhana were never a community that was appreciated by the Naga of my faith. In their history lessons, they described the crocodiles as savage and bloodthirsty monsters, brought down to their lowest instincts, without a sliver of mercy or dignity. I was told about how many cities were lost to them more than a thousand years ago, when they flooded down from the mountains near the Shadowswamp, in the middle of a civil war. How it took almost all Lizardfolk to hold them back from the shores, but never fully beat them. And about how lizardfolk haven’t been ever truly whole since it happened.\nImagine then everyone’s surprise when the Naga brought to me news of my future bride. A daughter of the Karashan tribe, which was under my attack, in exchange for their fealty as I’ve been supposedly recognized as superior to them. I was told that the situation has changed and I’ve seen some of it already - these folk were not all how they were described to me. In fact, their tactics were not really different from what you could commonly see… until the fight truly started. In that moment, something entranced their small warband, pulling them to fight until they couldn’t.\nEven now despite their fealty, these folk have trouble embracing the true faith and embracing the authority of Naga, favoring their own odd customs over their overlord’s faith. Anzara would force them to kneel. We see their willingness to cooperate, that needs to be nurtured in order to connect them to the lizardfolk community. We just need to change our approach and try to encourage them to join us, instead of imposing our ideals like they are still the mindless mob that they once were. It may be our only chance to settle this peacefully, after all."

 rayaz_5_3_title:0 "Our Cure to the Curse"
 rayaz_5_3_desc:0 "Those few years I’ve had so far with my wife have told me about the nature of their battle trance and how the Ashhana have to live with it, whether they want it or not. That she was sacrificed to prevent bloodshed, which caused them to lose their minds. She also told me about people who indulged themselves in this mind fog. How they need to be stopped. \nIt is a hard choice to make, but sadly there is no grey zone when it comes to the Ashhana. Each of them need to be approached with extreme empathy or complete lack of mercy. Those who are willing to cooperate, must be secured and cared for and isolated from the freaks who have nothing but bloodshed on their minds. If there is one man who can bring them back into the Anzalkatsa faithful, then it must be me. I can only hope that this will not end in a culling."

 rayaz_5_4_title:0 "Last of The Defiant"
 rayaz_5_4_desc:0 "Most people who enjoy my company sadly know how hard to reach I can be. Constantly busy and constantly away in the vicinity of my Naga advisors, my work unfortunately leaves me little time to handle issues of the chieftains and the merchants, despite my greatest efforts. Some of them actively scheme against my advisors, trying to curtail their much needed influence.\nBut on the other side of Taneyas, a different threat emerges. A rumor of the only living son of Shalazar’s monarch ascending to the throne fill my Naga allies with what I see as justified fear. As a prodigy of their own kind, he is already a dangerous enemy to have, but if he is to take over rule over Shalazar, then not only will this option become a fact, but also his sole existence as such will be a huge blow to the legitimacy of my claims.\nAt the same time, we are still claimed by those who led to this situation in the first place, by culling most of the Moonwarden royal family. The Zulbur tribe stands as a behemoth across the Ashhana and a direct antagonist to my efforts to bring the Poisoned back to the Anzalkatsa faithful.\nAll of these threats need to be dealt with immediately with a show of strength. Once this is done, everyone will finally understand that no one can contest our claim as the Final Empire."

 #Events
 rayaz_event.1.t:0 "Reminiscing on the Past"
 rayaz_event.1.d:0 "I stand upon a hill looking at my warband. Thousands of gazes from six tribes - Arazin, Yushyn, Lata, Alashkatsa, Karashan, Rayaz - staring directly at me, piercing through my body like a million spears. They wait to hear the reason that brought them all into the banks of Adzalas. They look at me with an awe that should be reserved only for the gods. For them, I alone need to be the perfect one, as I am the bringer of the final empire. Or so they say. \n\nThat was already supposed to happen 21 years ago. When the Naga expected nothing, but a crushing victory against their banishers in Zerat. Everything was supposed to go exactly as it went in the games I played with my brothers. I was a prodigy, they said. In their illusion, I saw nothing to worry about. But when I enforced it into reality, I was forced into a stalemate. Rivers of blood, year after year in a relentless and merciless invasion. Villages and towns plundered to sustain our armies. Five grueling years of war, resulting in a peace that satisfied no one, as both sides became exhausted to the point where none could push its advantage.\nAs a result, the reputation of Sykar Riverclaw was contested for the first time. My Naga advisors, they tried to keep up the facade. I think it still works to some degree, but even a blind man could see that I was no longer spotless. The vision that I was a symbol of - an idealized, perfect future - no longer seemt so inevitable. People started to have doubts. Rumors started to spread. Naga try to tell me that it’s the enemy trying to undermine them. Do they really think that everyone is supposed to ignore reality? \n\nI snap back out of it, as I begin to hear the murmurs of the impatient tribesmen. This is exactly the thing that I need to prevent. So I break it, outlining a plan for the following five years. Its last point - Finish the wailing corpse of the 332nd and silence those who dare contest my claim of the Final Empire."
 rayaz_event.1.a:0 "Its first point - divide the final ransom given for the last five years of truce"
 rayaz_event.2.t:0 "Life of the Chosen One"
 rayaz_event.2.d:0 "My dear child, if you’re reading this, it means that I have passed away. I congratulate you on the honor of leading our men into what is hopefully a better future. I hope this farewell will be a healing salve for your mourning heart, as you discover a few more things about your father. About my accomplishments and “our” accomplishments.\n\nYou know about how I gathered the tribes to unify, overcoming their petty grievances. How I ripped out the cancer that leeched off lizardfolk in their extravagant palaces. How I offered refuge to the willing and unleashed my wrath on the hostile.\n\nBut if you ask those who you now rule over - who led them to join me - your answer will point you to the same people, every single one of them being a Naga. If you think that they only want us to succeed, then you are right, they do. On their terms.\n\nI’ve been under their patronage since I could only remember. Growing under their keen eye, receiving the best education I could along with my brothers. I could see my father grow proud as we flourished. Before I could protest, he was cast aside from his function as a chieftain, as I replaced him. And as it was with the most people I cared about, he was cast into the background with haste the moment he wasn’t needed.\n\nWith that done, their prophecy rang across all the tribes, setting the stage for their plans. All my former enemies soon approached me with a greedy smile, looking at me not like a person, but a tool. And I was forced to reciprocate. I was only told to do what I do the best. The rest would be handled by them. And so, I lived as the extension of their ambitions, leading their armies, while they handled diplomacy, administration, even my love life. My successes never got to be truly mine and I couldn’t protest anything, lest I suffer a fate worse than death. \nThat extends to you as well. If you don’t want yourself and your children’s name scratched from every tablet stored, be loyal to the Naga. If you want independence, prove you can be useful to them. If you want their respect, befriend them in a way I couldn’t. I wish you best of luck in that, my child. \nAnd lastly, I’m sorry you will have to live through the hell that I had to go through."
 rayaz_event.2.a:0 "P.S. Don’t pick up that stupid Nazhyn. The withdrawals suck."
 rayaz_event.3.t:0 "We Were Never Alone"
 rayaz_event.3.d:0 "Despite how it may appear on the map, my domain isn’t as united as it may seem. Many of the tribes that willfully joined Rayaz, remain very powerful in their own lands, as their participation under my rule is held solely by their good faith and the belief in the prophecy.\nThis delicate state is now threatened by Katyradz betraying our alliance and choosing a path of his own. As he is a part of the prophecy as well, he is a viable option to replace me as the one to bring the Final Empire and this fact alone is enough for some opportunists to start exploiting my relationship with them.\nThus, the chieftains of Lata and Alashkatsa came before me with a rather bold demand: Give them autonomy or risk their secession."
 rayaz_event.3.a:0 "Outrageous! I will never allow such weakness"
 rayaz_event.3.b:0 "We cannot afford to lose them"
 rayaz_event.4.t:0 "Fate of the Bulwark States"
 rayaz_event.4.d:0 "A remnant of a failed policy, the bulwark states served Zerat as protectors of their realms from foreign threats as well as a retirement home for the disgraced members of their large family. \nThose states now offer us their loyalty and help in pacifying their kin in exchange for a great deal of autonomy on their lands. This is especially apparent for the Yushyn, who have previously joined our cause and are now expecting to be repaid for their attendance on the right side of the conflict.\nAt the same time… that offer will only give refuge to those who we tried to oust from the power once and for all."
 rayaz_event.4.a:0 "We know who you are, no need for your services"
 rayaz_event.4.b:0 "This war has claimed too many souls, grant their request"
 rayaz_event.5.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 rayaz_event.5.d:0 "With the dawn of the Final Empire, a decision must be made on where its seat of power will lie. Many cities were sponsored in an effort to hopefully perform this function and now we are blessed with many good options to choose from. Which one will it be?"
 rayaz_event.5.a:0 "I'd rather stay here, in safety of the jungle"
 rayaz_event.5.b:0 "Move to the center of science, culture and commerce we cultivated"
 rayaz_event.5.c:0 "No place is as accessible as the shore"
 rayaz_event.5.d1:0 "A more central position could be very beneficial"
 rayaz_event.5.e:0 "No matter where it would be, it belongs near the spires"
 rayaz_event.6.t:0 "Humiliated and Vulnerable"
