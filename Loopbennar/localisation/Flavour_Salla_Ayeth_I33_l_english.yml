 flavour_ayeth.1.t:0 "At Ayethstir Gates"
 flavour_ayeth.1.d:0 "I have returned with my warband to the outskirts of Ayethstir. Not as victors, not yet, but our excursion deep into the enemy lines was quite successful.\nThe path here winds through groves older than those invaders, where the trees are too ancient to bend and too proud to bloom. Their roots twist like the fingers of old sentinels and with each step we take, the ground groans with the hollow breath of limestone veins that run deep and wide beneath our home. Our Grove was never peaceful, but it was also never silent. Now? Even the caverns below us are quiet.\nAyethstir itself stands untouched for now. There is no siege, no watchfires in the hills, no horns or drums sounding from the dark. The gates of the city are closed, but not broken. The faded green banners with crossed silver arrows are faded, yet they still proudly weave in the breeze. There is no smoke on the horizon, only the rustle of ancient leaves and the faint scent of moss and stone. The air is tight, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. In the silence I can hear my rangers whisper that the orcs move like shadows in their encampments, gathering in gladeways and valleys. They have not yet struck. But they will.\nIn the stillness, I think of my mother. I think of what we lost when the Blackmoon came. And I think of what I have become in chasing them from grove to grove, leaving only blood and broken messages in their wake. Ayethstir will not fall again. We will not wait behind its walls and hope the trees protect us or the caverns collapse below their feet. The forest is calm now. And before the sound of war drums reaches our land, I must go to the inner hall, where my father awaits for we have words yet to speak."

 flavour_ayeth.2.t:0 "The Silent Throne"
 flavour_ayeth.2.d:0 "The great hall of Ayethstir is quieter now than it ever was in war. No commands are barked, no horns, no drums, no thrum of drawn bowstrings - just the hush that follows after something truly valuable breaks. Outside, the wind tugs at the bones of the roof, prying loose planks with hollow groans. The rafters above me creak like the limbs of a dying tree. Dead leaves drift in through open slats, gathering in wood-hewn corners. My boots are soft against the ruined floor, not daring to disturb the accusatory silence that surrounds me, asking me if I know what I'm doing. I don't.\nHe's here, my father. Not on the highseat, where once he sat, not standing with his hunting cloak billowing like clouds of thunder behind him, no. He sits beneath it now, his back to stone, knees drawn in like a child. His cloak clings to him like burial cloth, eyes open, but unfocused. Dull. Clouded. Not seeing anything. I stop just before him. I want to speak, but the words feel caught, like a hand meeting a knar on an armrest of a chair.\n“Father.” - No answer. Only the sound of the wind scratching at the doors. I crouch beside him. My hand touches his shoulder, yet his body doesn't flinch, just sags more deeply into itself. “Father. Look at me.”\nHis gaze finally shifts, a familiar flicker in them - now dim and weak, like a coal losing its glow. “You cannot lead like this,” I say. “If you won't stand, then please let me.” A long pause, a blink, a slow, brittle turn of the old head and at last, words - dry and cracked:\n“And what would you do, Elaria? March through every glade, torch every warren, spill blood until the pain fades?” He asks.\n“I would act, because someone has to. Father, you mourn, we all do, but you mourn like you're already dead.” My words pierce him like an arrow pierces the hide of an ancient stag. “Father, I didn't come to beg, I came to ask. One last time.”\nHis hands reach for the clasp as his shoulder and unfasten his cloak. He pushes its weight into my palm. “I will not stop you,” he says, barely louder than a breath."

 flavour_ayeth.3.t:0 "Final Farewell"
 flavour_ayeth.3.d:0 "The mound I dug is still fresh. The soil doesn't yet know how to hold loss, refusing to accept him. I planted his bow above him. The string is frayed, the wood cracked and dry. One limb bends where it shouldn't. It's useless now, but it stands taller than me. On it, I hang the cloak he gave me six years ago. The wind stirs it, softly. It's not enough to move branches, but just enough to sound like a breath that escaped from lungs of a tired warrior.\n\n“Father…” It scrapes out of me, like I had never said it before. And maybe I hadn't, at least not like this. “You too… you too have left me.” My words are too loud in the quiet, they echo in my ribs as my mind is filled with one thought and one thought only…\n\n“I am alone now.” The thought swirls in my head, clawing my eyelids, trying to open them and force them to let out a tear down my cheek. It doesn't happen. “I bled for these woods, I bled for you…” I say, my voice cracking. “... What good is vengeance if you're not here to see it? What good is justice to the souls of the dead?”\n\nMy voice rises, “you've told me to hold back, that restraint was the mark of a true ceann and look where that led us. Look!” I shout as I strike the ground. Pain rings up my arm, but it's distant, dull, like I was watching myself do it, instead of feeling it myself.\n\n“I would give everything for one more night by the fire, one more walk without words by your side.” My vision blurs, but still the brook of my tears dares not escape. “I carry the salla now and I don't know how to do it without you watching. I don't know how to be anything but what's left… I am not strong, father. I never was. I am just…”"

I stand alone, feet solid against the damp earth. The rustle of reeds breaks the stillness - and there she stands. My mother.\n\nNot a memory, but an apparition from my broken mind. Her hair, the colour of autumn leaves, frames a face unchanged by time. Her bright eyes meet mine with a gentle sadness. I open my mouth, but no words come.\n\n"Elaria," she says, voice soft like the wind. "What is it you seek now?"\n"I seek justice," I answer, cold and hard. "I seek vengeance."\n"Vengeance?" She steps closer, her gaze heavy with love and sorrow. "Is that all? To burn the world until there is nothing left? Can you not see what this has done to you?"\n\nHer words twist in my chest. Still, I do not turn away.\n\n"What would you have me do, mother?" My voice breaks. "Our people suffer. They mock us. The very earth bleeds. They must pay for what they did to you!"\nShe sighs, a sound heavy with sorrow. "I know your grief. I know your rage. But this is not the way."\n"You don't understand," I snarl. "You're not here. You didn't see everything slip away. You didn't hold your lifeless mother in your arms."\n\nHer gaze softens, and for a moment, I see her as she once was — full of love and patience.\n\n"You have become something unrecognizable, Elaria," she says. "You have become what you hate."\nI step back, fists clenched.\n"No. I am not like them."\nBut she shakes her head, sorrow in her eyes.\n"You already are."\n\nHer words strike deep. The rage that has carried me falters. Doubt, small and insistent, worms its way through the cracks. Maybe... she is right.\n"I can't stop," I whisper.\n\nShe reaches out, her hand warm on my cheek.\n\n"You must forgive yourself, my son.

Weather and scarred, yet at the same time enduring and alive.\nI walk their paths again. There was a time when each stone in Ayethstir seemed to whisper of the dead. When every root I stepped over felt like a grave of a world I had failed to protect. When laughter - if I heard it at all - felt like a great sin against those who are no longer among us. As if joy had no right to return where so much had been lost. But now…\nI hear voices. Not the cries of battle, not the moans of mourning, but the simple voices of life: children running between trees older than memory, elders planting saplings beside their houses, songs drifting from hearths instead of war camps. And still, I am here, not wearing grief like I once did. It no longer wraps me like armor. I do not wake with her name caught in my throat, or see my father's gaze in every shadowed corner.\nThis weight it never truly leaves. It never can, but I have learnt how to live with it. How to conjure it in moments of weakness and turn the bitterness of separation into a foundation of strength. There are moments - quiet, fleeting - when I feel the sun on my face and do not think of the pyres, when I pass the carved stone bearing my father's name and I do not fall to my knees. When I say my mother's name - Vehari - and it doesn't taste like ash.\nThere was a time I feared healing, as if forgetting pain meant betraying their memory. As if letting go, meant letting them die for nothing. But I understand now, they did not want me to burn in their names, they wanted me to live. And it is because of you that I still do.\nYou could have let me slip into vengeance, let me drown in blood and call it justice, you could have turned your face from mine and let me rot in silence, but you didn't. You stayed, you stood beside me when I was no longer worthy of it and bore the weight I could not carry. You gave me something I could not find in myself - the belief that I was not beyond saving.

The Wood Elves kneel to me, the goblin warrens have been burned, their bones fed to the roots, orcish warbands lie scattered, hunted to the last. The eastern groves whisper only in Elven tongue once more, for there are no more monsters in these woods.\nAnd yet, when I walk the beaten paths of Ayethstir - I feel nothing. The air is the same. The trees still arch like vaults of a tomb above me and in their shade I find no comfort, their silence no longer soothes. Some say that the forest sings again. That children dance in the boughs, that lovers once again carve their names into bark and festivals rise beneath moonlight.\nBut I… I feel nothing. No warmth, no pride, no peace. I killed for her. I bled for her memory. I shattered our alliances, I hunted  those who betrayed us, I made monsters fear my name, I tore through the rot with my arrows, I made sure no one would ever forget what was done to her.\nAnd now, there is no one left to kill and the silence… the silence remains. The grief is no longer loud. It does not scream in my head, it merely sits beside me, each night, like an old companion. Quiet, familiar and utterly unmovable. There is no redemption, no triumph, no moment where the pain lifts and the sun breaks through, only the endless, choking question: Was this what she would have wanted? - No. No, she would have wept. I see her face when I close my eyes. For years, I wore her memory like a cloak, but every step I took dragged me further from who she loved.\nAnd you… You stood behind me. You, who called this strength, who chose this path. You, who let me fall, again and again, because you wanted vengeance too, didn't you? Because it was satisfying, because blood is easier than healing.\nSo look at me now! Look at what you've made. Don't turn your gaze away - I am a ruler. I am feared. I am victorious. And I am alone.

 flavour_ayeth.16.d:0 "The battle was chaotic - bodies clashed like waves against roots and rocks, arrows singing above us, and the forest groaning beneath the trampling of thousands. Yet even in the madness, there came a stillness. A moment in which all the world held its breath. The Deepwoods were silent, save for one.\nThere he stood - Oberon Faelganr - astride a great stag wreathed in the light of fey, his hair wild, his voice rising above the din. Commanding, proud, untouched by blood, he towered over the melee. He pointed eastward with his glaive, driving the orcs further away from our homes. The tide was turning.\nMy bow was already drawn. He has ushered the command, once, in another grove, many years ago. He had told his clan to follow him on his mad gambit, leading orcs through the Eastern Groves. He has led them through the Flower Grove, the River Grove, the Shadow Grove, up until the Arrow Grove, while the orcish horde rampaged in pursuit, razing to the ground all they encountered. Including the small village next to Yffnu Ynde, where my mother fell.\nI felt my mother's hand on my shoulder, her screams… The long silence that followed. And how this silence was broken now - a hero atop a beast, lauded by those who had not buried what I buried. One arrow. That's all it would take. A missed step, a rogue shaft let loose in the smoke and confusion of the battle, his stag rearing in panic, the forest swallowing the sound of the bowstring.\nThere are things we must never admit aloud - not even to ourselves. Things that cannot be put to trial, or laid to rest - only acted upon. I let the arrow loose…"
