 ###REFORM DESC###
 anbennar_call_for_reforms_desc:0 "Ever since the Wars of Rule, the Empire of Anbennar has stood strong against the chaotic forces that surround our borders. But in recent decades the imperial administration has become bloated, rising noble and mage tensions bring violent conflict, and an internal rot has set in eating at Imperial Authority.\n\nMake no doubt about it, we are in a slow decline. However if we embrace sizable and speedy reforms, we may be able to stop and even reverse our decay."
 anbennar_imperial_adventurer_companies_desc:0 "Adventurers have been many a boon and bane to desperate rulers throughout history. They fashion themselves as heroes but are little more than mercenary warbands. However one cannot deny the usefulness of these foolhardy disposable warriors, many imperial princes hire these adventuring companies for their wars.\n\nIt is beneficial to seek the formalisation of the hiring of these warriors and ease some requirements. By officially recognizing a few as imperial approved adventuring companies, we can negotiate their exorbitant costs and empower the imperial princes."
 anbennar_guarantee_temple_rights_desc:0 "As the Corinite Reformation rages on, the Imperial Temples grow uneasy about their place in the Empire. We must reassure them of their sovereignty, but what’s more is we can use the influence and power of the temples to temper the flames of religious conflict.\n\nThe Emperor will declare a proclamation to guarantee temple rights and more autonomy in their day to day functions. But the imperial administration intends to press for an open-mindedness even amongst our most zealous clerics. Hopefully they return a like minded response to our grace."
 anbennar_reinforce_imperial_frontiers_desc:0 "The Gawedi Eagle looms north and the Lorentish Rose seeks to strangle us from the west among other threats. The Empire’s defenses are crumbling and enemy armies threaten us from all sides. But by focusing resources of the Empire towards reinforcing its frontiers and providing a steady supply of fresh troops and materials to our marches, we will be able to put forward a formidable defense."
 anbennar_permanent_parliament_desc:0 "Calling the Imperial parliament is a severe logistical challenge that impedes our response to crises affecting the Empire. If we were to proclaim a permanent residence for the Parliament, staffed with representatives for each imperial prince and communicating to their overlords by sending stone, we could have an Empire responsive to terrible challenges by the minute."
 anbennar_imperial_dynasty_desc:0 "In 1421, the Battle of the Moon Council erupted ending in the deaths of electors, an assassination attempt on the imperial candidate Adenn Skylance, and a war that lasted for two decades nearly destroying the Empire of Anbennar. All because of these violent political games around the Imperial Elections.\n\nIf we were to instead declare the Emperor title as hereditary, such political intrigue that plagues the Empire would be hampered. However it would also demand immediate subservience of the imperial princes to bend their knee to the Emperor. History would be made if this decision was passed through the Imperial Parliament."
 anbennar_nobles_of_the_wand_desc:0 "Due to the ever rising influence of Empire's elite classes, there has been a tenuous equilibrium between the imperial princes and the mages. More times than not, it has devolved into competition and violent political intrigue with the mages recently taking the upperhand. If the Emperor were to empower the mages within the noble class, perhaps this balance could be thrown out entirely with the dominant sorcerous faction taking control."
 anbennar_enable_magisterium_governance_desc:0 "The Magisterium is one of the key underpinnings of the Empire. Created after the Wars of Rule to consolidate mage influence and work together with the Empire to rule Anbennar, it has been a key player in regulating and controlling imperial magical affairs. Their reign has likely stopped many dark wizards from ever ascending into power.\n\nIf funding were to increase, privileges shifted from the competing noble mage organization, the Orda Aldresia, to the Magisterium, and ability for said mages to take executive action between imperial disputes; the Empire could start a new epoch of magical power."
 anbennar_erelas_doctrine_desc:0 "Difficult times lay ahead for the Empire. But the sorcerers and wizards of the Empire have taken notice, and are willing to serve. The Emperor contemplates passing into law the Erelas Doctrine, a document establishing the Imperial Mage Intelligence Organization staffed by primarily illusionist and divination wizards.\n\nWhile seemingly innocuous at first, this simple information gathering bureau has rights to investigate and arrest imperial princes, power over all printing press houses, and even autonomy from the parliament. It provides oversight for all, but has none for itself."
 anbennar_regulate_artificery_desc:0 "The creation of Artificery was at first an exciting prospect, but many mages call such inventions unnatural. Many even express intentions to outright ban such a practice for heresy. In a way, the Djinn is out of the bottle and the Empire is unlikely to completely remove Artificery, however limits can be placed.\n\nThe parliament has sent a law to the Emperor, regulating Artificery and allowing several mage organizations authority to limit these practices anywhere in the Empire. Dissenters have argued that this is a naked grab for power by the mages, fearful of their losing their grip on magic to innovation. It is up to the Emperor to pass the law or reject it."
 anbennar_imperial_wizards_desc:0 "The Imperial War Mage Academy in Anbenncost has been a center of learning for the Empire but in recent decades has opted for a more academic approach to learning. The original intent was to train war mages for the Empire to fight and kill for Anbennar. That intent has been led astray, and the Emperor intends to revitalize the academy.\n\nBy establishing the Order of The Imperial War Wizards, reorganizing the Academy, and funneling graduates to the Order, the Empire can have a steady supply of powerful and zealous battlemages at the ready."
 anbennar_mages_peace_desc:0 "Never since the Wars of Rule have the mages of the Empire been so powerful. Indomitable and unassailable, these mages are loyal to the Emperor and question the endless politicking, backstabbing, and bickering by the Imperial Nobility.\n\nThe Grand Magister suggests flexing the new power of the mages to the princes. No more imperial politics, no more dubious wars, only the law of magic."

 anbennar_expand_marquis_rank_desc:0 "The Empire ails on all fronts, most notably on its failing military dominance. With Escann rising, the Northern Eagle hunting, and the Western Rose blooming, the Emperor is fraught seeking to shore up Imperial defenses.\n\nThe Imperial Parliament has proposed the expansion of the Marquis. A military title and designation for powerful Imperial Princes, it gives privileges and a duty to protect the Empire against all threats. Legislation is set to appear before the Emperor soon, and it even suggests inviting new powers into the Empire under this designation."
 anbennar_internal_divisions_title:0 "Formalise Internal Administrative Divisions"
 anbennar_internal_divisions_desc:0 "Havoc and chaos is what the Imperial Administration has become since the start of the Lilac War. Dozens of imperial princes and hundreds of their retinues vying for hearings, judicial compromises over disputes, and favor with the Emperor in administering their lands.\n\nThe Imperial Court strains under the weight of every region and so decentralization is being considered. The Emperor contemplates a form of regional self-governance. By dividing the Empire into different courts, they among themselves can deal with local problems while more pressing trans-regional issues can be sent to parliament."
 anbennar_electoral_council_title:0 "Equalise The College of Electors"
 anbennar_electoral_council_desc:0 "The Wars of Rule, a terrible clash between mages and lords, ended with the Mage’s peace and the establishment of the Magisterium as an Elector within the Empire. However since then, the mages have sought to expand their power throughout the centuries. The nobles in response attempt to counter the mage’s power and of recent one piece of legislation proposes to expand The College of Electors.\n\nIn a direct challenge to the Magisterium’s authority, the nobles propose to elevate Orda Aldresia as the eight elector. An order of noble mage knights, they are the rivals of the Magisterium and threaten to tip the status quo in favor of the nobility. Even if the mage knights are not chosen, an eight elector alone would dilute the mage’s political influence."
 anbennar_imperial_embassies_title:0 "Establish Imperial Embassies"
 anbennar_imperial_embassies_desc:0 "The Empire of Anbennar on paper is a unified entity that acts in lock step with each other. In practice, they are dozens of squabbling princes that all petition the Emperor over the most minute internal conflicts whether it be political or trade. This detracts the Emperor from focusing on more pressing external threats and situations.\n\nOne elector suggests the Emperor allows for the establishment of Imperial Embassies among the princes. This would delegate power to diplomatically handle their disputes amongst each other and free the Imperial Court to deal with outside powers more efficiently."
 anbennar_empower_imperial_diet_title:0 "Elevate The Imperial Diet"
 anbennar_empower_imperial_diet_desc:0 "The Imperial Diet can be a frustrating institution to imperial nobility. It can propose, it can suggest, it can give an opinion but it has no real legal power. To the mages, this is a welcomed status quo but even to Emperors it is a dead end for any real noble initiative. Should the parliament be anointed with real legal power, the Emperor could rally a unified nobility to confront any domestic or legal issues regardless of any opinion of the mages."
