A45_silence_of_the_bards_title: "Silence of the Bards"
A45_silence_of_the_bards_desc: "The end of the Lilac Wars brought with it great tragedy, but while many greater wrongs still have yet to be righted, there is a far more personal grudge that must first be settled. In fair Seinathil, a branch family of our Duchess' own Silistra family rules the small nation of bards. They are poets, not warriors. Perhaps that is why they saw fit to turn their backs on the main branch of the family, and their oaths to the Emperor by siding with the Rose party. This stain on our ruling dynasty's good name will not be tolerated, and we must bring Senathil to account for its traitorous actions. After all, for bards who twist words around frivolously to change their meaning, do oaths really hold any value? We must teach them that they do."

A45_raising_a_renaissance_title: "Raising a Renaissance"
A45_raising_a_renaissance_desc: "Across Cannor a new age of culture and knowledge blooms, as scholars and artists funded by the wealthy and powerful of Anbennar delve into the knowledge of the past, our Castanorian and Damerian forebears. Were the grand duchy alive today no doubt it would be the centre of old Damerian revival, but no matter. As her inheritor it shall be we that sponsors the said revival, our own perspective added atop. With the Duchesses example it has become clear to us that change is necessary, particularly as it concerns the women of our realm."

A45_women_in_the_workforce_title: "Women in the Workforce"
A45_women_in_the_workforce_desc: "Compared to much of Halann, it is undoubtedly true that Istralore has little discrimination between its sexes. Elves hold no such notions of differing merit, and it is from them that we inherit our attitudes. Still, it is also true that in our fields and our mines it remains mostly men that toil. Why should it be so? To deprive the tools of another hand? Let us encourage our women too to work outside the home."

A45_by_her_light_title: "By Her Light"
A45_by_her_light_desc: "With each passing day it becomes more and more clear we were right to put our faith in Corin. Not that we doubted in the first place of course, but our swift strides in setting right the tragic consequences of the lilac wars can only be the sign of the goddesses favour - surely she is pleased! We consider ourselves amongst her foremost adherents on Halann, and it is only right that we should act the part."

A45_rose_covered_twilight_title: "Rose Covered Twilight"
A45_rose_covered_twilight_desc: "Once we bathed in the sweet pale light of the moon.\n\nFor long years we knew our place - knew our duty and purpose - the right hand of Dameria, her first and most loyal vassal. Those times are gone now, our light snuffed out by the suffocating rose and its traitorous supplicants, imperial princes without a shred of honour of loyalty. To believe that those of Wesdam could bear the name Silmuna and betray their own blood is almost unthinkable, yet sometimes reality is worse than nightmare.\n\nAll such oathbreakers will earn their just deserts sooner or later, but our attention must turn to our own borders first. The snake duke of Cesitrande eyes our lands with greed, thinking us weak and exhausted, our duchess young and inexperienced. He may be right, but he forgets our spirit. Even in the twilight we shall shine."

A45_the_broken_lance_title: "The Broken Lance"
A45_the_broken_lance_desc: "Duke Vincen sil Cestir, lord of Cestirande, of men more vile there are few.\n\nFamous for his wit, the sly duke was once a vassal of our mother Dameria, only to turn coat the disastrous battle of the moon council. Ever the opportunist, there he renounced his loyalty to his rightful liege, branding Adenn Skylance “Brokenlance of the Waning Moon” in scorn.\n\nNow he delivers to us a snapped spear, emblazoned with Adenns own crest, a cruel provocation - no doubt meant to goad us into rash action. He will succeed, at least in that, but he knows not the fury he brings upon himself. Our Aucanna may be young, but she knows war, and the serpentine duke will learn Istralore still has bite."

A45_revive_the_banshees_title: "Revive the Banshees"
A45_revive_the_banshees_desc: "The Istralari Banshees - the screaming warrior-women adherents of our great namesake Istralania Warsinger herself - are in a dire way. Depleted and run ragged by their service in the lilac wars, our elite all woman regiment is practically disbanded in all but name. This sorry state of affairs clearly cannot continue, but it will take a great effort to revive and reforge the Banshees anew. Still, peace and victory give us the opportunity and inspiration to do so, and with some effort, soon new hopefuls will flock to the Warsingers banner."

A45_homecoming_title: "Homecoming"
A45_homecoming_desc: "With the commons and eastern damesear under our benevolent control, the rest of the damerian core territories now cry out for liberation from their tyrannical and traitorous overlords. We shall send our armies west, and bring them back into the fold, for all damerians must ultimately be united under one banner.\n\nAs for the matter of Wesdam, kinslayers and oathbreakers, there can be no mercy. They are no true Silmunas, they forsook that name when they sided with the rose, and their claim to the west dameshead is null and void. We shall see them stamped from existence."

A45_flame_in_the_dawn_title: "Flame in the Dawn"
A45_flame_in_the_dawn_desc: "Hope is a fragile and fickle thing, but always it endures. Here in darkness it can be hard to see the light, yet we look to the east and see a flame.\n\nThe newly ascended Goddess Corin is that flame, and the hope she offers is that good can triumph over evil - even when that evil seems insurmountable, an unending tide breaking all that is known and right. Like Corin, and like Istralania before her, we will gird ourselves for battle and hold hope in our hearts."

A45_the_grand_tournament_title: "The Grand Tournament"
A45_the_grand_tournament_desc: "To our hall comes news of a great tournament, rich and lavish, to be attended by lords and ladies the empire over. A gesture of peace from the new Emperor, a celebration of a fresh start. Hah! As if fake war and fights made farce could ever make us forget our fallen friends or forgive our fickle foes.\n\nPerhaps we should simply not attend and take a stand against the false peace on offer, but the Duchess has another idea. We shall send a competitor, one seasoned by war and conflict, a competitor who shall fight under the banner of the moon."

A45_loyal_to_the_last_title: "Loyal to the Last"
A45_loyal_to_the_last_desc: "It is perhaps shameful to admit, but we were not the last of the moon's light to dim. That honour goes to the Orda Aldresia, imperial bodyguard, who for all the world seemed determined to fight to the last. Though they did not, we should thank them for it, for such men and women of honour already bitterly resented their service to a usurper, and now with his true treachery revealed surely shall not need much of a push to stand behind us - Damerias true heir!"

A45_dreams_of_dameria_title: "Dreams of Dameria"
A45_dreams_of_dameria_desc: "They say that Dameria is dead, a shattered realm nary to rise again, but we know better - for Dameria lives in us.\n\nFrom the moment we reclaimed the middle luna we have staked our claim as Dameria’s Heir, and now it is time at last to carry that claim against the great usurper. The commons and the eastern damesear languish even now under the Wexonard yoke, their peoples squeezed beneath that cruel thumb. Our armies stand ready, and soon Anbennar will see that the dream of Dameria is not dead."

A45_damerias_heir_title: "Dameria's Heir"
A45_damerias_heir_desc: "Not even the greatest of fools can deny we are Dameria’s heir, now that we wear her great mantle and her lands prosper under our rule. We know that Adénn and Vincen would be proud of us, and no doubt Istralania and Munas would smile to see their realms combined, yet some questions still linger.\n\nIn the time since old Dameria fell, we of Istralore have had to strike out as our own people, and in so doing have become something more than what we were before. Are we simply the dutiful restorer we once were? Shall we be content to rule as the Silmuna’s - to sit atop the dove throne and preside from above, righteous and silver tongued? Or is our lot to be a new type of Emperor, an Emperor who holds their own sword one who leads from the front.\n\nSome small things remain to be settled before the question of Dameria can be resolved, not least of which Anbenncost returned to the realm, but the question of our identity must be settled, and soon."

A45_his_final_moments_title: "His Final Moments"
A45_his_final_moments_desc: "The Story of Adenn Skylance ends with his death in an honourable duel at the hands of the usurper - at least, so says he. This rings hollow to the ear, for how could the greatest warrior of the day lose in single combat to such an inferior foe, lacking strength of arm and righteousness of heart?\n\nSurely the usurper's magic played a role, a truth that must be exposed so the good princes of the empire may all see the usurper for what he truly is, liar and forsaker. With the aid of our mages, perhaps the truth may be divined by spell and scrying, mayhaps we can peer into the past and see our lieges' final moments."

A45_to_tame_wyverns_title: "To Tame Wyverns"
A45_to_tame_wyverns_desc: "The men of Verne claim the wyvern as their banner, a mighty symbol and a mighty beast indeed. It is a tragedy then that the wyvern is no longer ridden, a knowledge that was burnt by the Dukes when Verne was conquered by Dameria some two centuries ago.\n\nWord comes from the court of Verne that the new Duke has found a hidden cache of scrolls with the ancient techniques, and now seeks to bind Wyverns to his cause anew. As our staunch ally, it is only right we should lend our aid to his effort, so that Verne may once again send Wyvern to war."

A45_moonrise_on_bal_hyl_title: "Moonrise on Bal Hyl"
A45_moonrise_on_bal_hyl_desc: "The stolen lands of Dameria may be restored to us, but let us not forget in our jubilation that the Wexonard usurpers and their allies still persist, cowering in their ‘Wexkeep’. Bal Hyl it was called before them, an ancient castanorian citadel. It is undeniably beautiful, its lofty walls atop the hills towering over the landscape around. A shame then it is darkened by the stain of its owners, a blight that we shall have to burn away before it might glitter under the moonlight once more."

A45_fallen_lilac_petals_title: "Fallen Lilac Petals"
A45_fallen_lilac_petals_desc: "Dameria as we knew it may be gone, but not all is lost. Many of our friends and allies are now as we, bruised, perhaps battered, but not broken. We must be to them now what Dameria once was to us, a friend, an ally, a source of unity. Together we shall endeavour to survive in the usurpers new Anbennar, and yet still change the futures course.\n\nOf all the things broken in the lilac wars, of all the fallen petals strewn around, the bonds forged between us are not one."

A45_remnant_remembrance_title: "Remnant Rembrance"
A45_remnant_remembrance_desc: "Long have the elves of moonhaven been our allies and neighbours, fellow loyal vassals of dameria, stalwart of the eastern dameshead. They are the natural first course in our journey to reunite the shattered moon party.\n\nElven blood may have centuries since dispersed throughout the veins of our rulers - the illustrious Silistra dynasty - but we still can claim the same heritage as they, from the elves of the remnant fleet. We shall have need of a navy in the times to come, so let us raise now a mighty fleet, and invite the elves to partake in the effort together - perhaps this homage to the origin of elves in Cannor will kindle hope as did the first arrival."

A45_istralari_ironworks_title: "Istralari Ironworks"
A45_istralari_ironworks_desc: "The dwarves of Silverforge have long toiled to build their hold, a monumental endeavour for which they have delved deep and greedily into the earth, yet still much more remains to be done. Our own dalemines produce some of the finest iron in Anbennar, and surely our dwarvish friends would appreciate it if we shared that bounty with them. Though we have no doubt our contribution will be ultimately meagre in their work, toil shared is toil lessened."

A45_corins_truth_title: "Corin's Truth"
A45_corins_truth_desc: "Now we see the reason - nay, the need - for her ascension! Castelos is dead, and has been dead for many long centuries! Praise Corin, who came to save man from the orcs when no god could. Praise Corin, the sword and shield of civilised peoples.\n\nIt is clear she must lead the court, her claim through Agrados is undeniable, though Adean may be Castellos’s son his failure to act against the greentide is a sure sign of his unworthiness, not as a god of course, but as a ruler. Corin has no such flaw, she shall not fail to act in future. We must declare for her cause, she shall need our support here on Halann, as we shall need hers above!"

A45_corins_sword_title: "Corin's Sword"
A45_corins_sword_desc: "The writings of Bluetusk speak of Corins Sword and Shield - the importance both of vanquishing evil and protecting what is dear, as she did when she slayed the dookanson with the thrust of her sword, whilst blocking his killing blow with her shield. We well understand the role of shield already, and must not fall to the same flaw as the Adeanics - to become dormant in protection. Thus it is time to take up the sword, and carry the word of our Goddess out against the world's evil!"

A45_in_her_image_title: "In Her Image"
A45_in_her_image_desc: "“As without, within.” - Nesta, Istralari Banshee Commander\n\nTo crusade in Corins name is to be righteous, for to rid the world of evil is the noblest of causes. Despite that, we must remember that it is not enough to wield the sword, the shield too cannot be neglected. As we do without we must do within, and hold ourselves and our subjects to the standards of our great goddess - but to imagine each man or woman may be righteous on their own merit is folly. Never forget that Corin did not stand alone. By promoting the emergent holy order, and constructing new martial communities across our realm, neither shall any Istralari."

A45_the_warsong_college_title: "The Warsong College"
A45_the_warsong_college_desc: "The education of our people combined with the martial culture we have instilled across our land has had quite a clear consequence, and now the best and brightest of our youth clamour for the opportunity to study war at a deeper level. Inspired and impressed by our commanders, so too across the empire do nobles and commoners alike seek the opportunity to send their sons and daughters to be trained in our ways.\n\nThe demand is flattering of course, and a testament to the virtue of our ways, but our existing infrastructure strains under it. Higher education has traditionally been reserved to the domain of the privileged, typically sons of the wealthy and noble. Let us change this. In Rincancas we shall raise a new institution, one who’s doors shall be open to any with ability, regardless of their sex or station. In memory of our founder, let it be known as Warsong."

A45_divine_demense_divided_title: "Divided Divine Domain"
A45_divine_demense_divided_desc: "The crimson deluge has ended, yet the struggle of the gods is not over - not till Adean admits his unworth to lead the court and bends his knee before Castelos’s true and rightful successor!\n\nThe conflict cannot be solved in the heavens, for a second godswar would be a terrible thing, and so we are charged with its resolution on Halann. When his supporters are defeated, when their weapons are laid down and Corins truth accepted in their hearts, Adean himself shall see his folly."

A45_upon_halann_as_in_heaven_title: "Upon Halann as in Heaven"
A45_upon_halann_as_in_heaven_desc: "It is over, and we have triumphed.\n\nCorins banner flies over the empire, and the members of her league gather at her altar. No doubt in the very heavens she now ascends Castellos seat - as well she should! Though Adeans' simpering supporters cling on, they are a dying sect, and it is time to be done with them.\n\nBy our Imperial right, we henceforth decree all subjects of Anbennar must adhere to her worship.\nBy our Imperial might, we shall enforce her supremacy across Anbennar."

A45_heavenly_authority_title: "Heavenly Authority"
A45_heavenly_authority_desc: "Across the empire spreads a strange kind of affliction, one that comes bearing charity and spreads learning.  To first glance, the Ravelians would seem a great boon, for it is of course good to be concerned with the place of the commons. Yet to take a closer look reveals a core that slowly rots. These so-called scholars and intellectuals pay not the proper deference to the divine! They use words like ‘saint’ for holy figures, and heed the word of a talking stone. They must be cast forth from the realm, rooted out wherever they nest - by our authority, and heavens!"

A45_blending_the_bloodlines_title: "Blending the Bloodlines"
A45_blending_the_bloodlines_desc: "To many, the name Silmuna was synonymous with the Emperorship, the Moon well settled upon the Dove Throne. Our own line is illustrious to be sure, but not so nearly tied with prestige and respect as the Silmunas. We shall have to learn from their example to legitimise our bloodline, marriage and prettied words our weapons.\n\nOne opportunity lies in Escann. Not all living Silmunas are traitors to the name, Rogier Silmuna having escaped the Lilac wars and settled in Escann, where he found Lothane Bluetusk and recognised him as trueblood. Now Lothanes line represents the true legitimate line, and by arranging a marriage between those of his blood and ours we too can share in the Silmuna name. The marriage will provide a lovely consort too, even if they are a bit… green."

A45_folding_in_the_family_title: "Folding in the Family"
A45_folding_in_the_family_desc: "Unity has given us strength beyond measure, strength enough to right the wrongs of history. Is it not right then, that we should aspire to ever closer union with our friends and allies? Those faithful who did not give up the cause, even when the moon had seemed to wane, deserve a place of honour not simply as mere princes, but as our valued and respected vassals. They may find this privilege hard to accept at first, for those of such true heart do, so we shall take up their causes to persuade them to our view - and for those who even then still wish to stand apart we shall be glad to."

A45_the_businori_bridgehead_title: "The Businori Bridgehead"
A45_the_businori_bridgehead_desc: "With our home secured at last, the eye may turn outward again - the sword hot to the hand.\n\nTo the south lies the region of Businor, land of the stone lions and gateway to the divenhal, long a bastion of independent kingdoms who refused the promise of Anbennar. Now we hear it becomes budding home to the Ravelian society, thinkers who whisper questions that border on heresy. Whatever the case may be, it is undeniable that an independent Businor is a threat to the security and prosperity of Anbennar. From behind the Khenak range any enemy may launch raids into our territory, threatening our territorial integrity, and from the isle of Tef traders intercept goods and wealth flowing from the newly discovered territories overseas before they reach the dameshead - leaving us second pickings!\n\nThe solution to these problems is simple. Businori will be brought into the empire and shown the light of Corin, one way or another."

A45_take_to_the_waves_title: "Take to the Waves"
A45_take_to_the_waves_desc: "For many long decades have the coasts of Anbennar known the presence of Akasi pirates, the gnolls of Viakkoc in particular so notorious as to earn the name Seascourge. Of course we have always protected our coasts as best we could, but the unending period of internal strife has prevented us from doing as we should and bringing a conclusive end to the threat.\n\nNo more should innocent Istralori suffer from the raiding and pillaging of demon worshippers! Let us rally to our banner, and raise a great host upon the sea - under the sealion banner we take to the waves once more!"

A45_khamshes_ek_kusret_title: "Khamshes ek Kusret"
A45_khamshes_ek_kusret_desc: "With peace at home, Businor secured as a bridgehead and our great navy raised, now is the time - Akasik shall be pacified.\n\nAcross the Divenhal we shall sail, and upon those distant shores we will liberate the poor peoples of Akasik from their rotten rulers. In so doing shall we end the threat of piracy once and for all, but equally as importantly we shall bring a new people into the congregation of the faithful.\n\nCorins word shall find fertile soil in Akasik, for many of them have broken from their theology of cycles already, seeing Corin as the saviour they so desperately need to change their fortune. Yet they by and large consider her as an ‘agent’ of their mother Akasik, a grandiose mistake to be sure, but one we shall be happy to correct. They shall take up the sword and shield as have we - the Khamshes et Kusret!"

A45_anbennar_means_title: "Anbennar Means..."
A45_anbennar_means_desc: "What is Anbennar?\n\nA promise perhaps. A promise of peace, an end to the squabbling of the interregnum. But it is more than that too, for a promise is only a word, at most a pact. Anbennar is not simply an oath, it is a realm, an entity unto itself. Anbennar lives in the mind of every life in its borders, it exists within us as much as outside. Then is Anbennar simply a kingdom, an empire, as many others claim to be across the breadth of Halann? Surely not, for there are none like us. Who else can claim to have elected their emperors, who else can claim to be many peoples, yet also one?\n\nAnbennar is neither of these things, for Anbennar is both. Anbennar is the past, and it is the future. Anbennars destiny is to be one, and we shall bring that destiny to fruition."

A45_marshal_of_the_empire_title: "Marshal of the Empire"
A45_marshal_of_the_empire_desc: "Since the founding of Anbennar, Istralore has been Marshal of the Empire, and even before that we loyally served as the same under the kingdom of Dameria. Now we are Emperors ourselves, and we may even grant the title of Marshall to another should we so choose, but never shall we forget our martial heritage. It is the privilege of the emperor to levy the princes for war, but in recent times this authority has waned. Now that we sit the dove throne, it shall be our priority to re-establish that ancient right."

A45_liberty_title:0"Liberty"
A45_liberty_desc: "We Istralari know duty. Duty is purpose, and cause, responsibility. So when as Emperor we find ourselves charged with the protection of Anbennar, with the integrity of the realm and the security of her princes, we take that charge seriously. Thus, looking at the borders to find princely states and provinces sat under the heel of foreign masters is a situation we cannot abide. Traitor Emperors may have been content to let their lorentish masters carve away chunks of the realm, but not we. Never we - let us instead bring liberty."

A45_the_fifth_lilac_war_title: "The Fifth Lilac War"
A45_the_fifth_lilac_war_desc: "The world may have thought the lilac wars ended with Dameria, but that is a lie. The lilac wars only paused, for as long as we draw breath the cause is not ended - it was only better not to be a martyr, better to bide time and wait, as we have.\nNow the moon waxes once again. The empire is united beneath us, no traitors wait to sabotage us from within, no cowards nor kinslayers lay with daggers for our backs. Lorent will quake for our coming. The Redfort shall fall, and Lorentaine will burn - with the warsong of the Banshees as the music of their demise."

A45_the_moon_shines_title: "The Moon Shines"
A45_the_moon_shines_desc: "All across Lencenor, word of the shall of Lorentaine spreads like wildfire. To the adherents of the rose it is the very essence of despair, and perhaps to whatever remnant cells of our once while allies yet still remain it is a message of hope. Istralore comes, and she brings the empire with her!\n\nAcross the length of the land our armies will march, bringing with them both Anbennars unity and Corins truth. Above them shall fly the banner of the Sealion and Moon both, for this is as much Dameria’s victory as it is ours. Let this be a testament to dedication and duty. No matter what tragedy may befall a cause, the fight is not over until the last believer's breath runs out. For as long as one Istralari held a sword the moon did not yet wane entirely - and now she shines above Lencenor anew."

A45_and_the_admirals_title: "And the Admirals"
A45_and_the_admirals_desc: "Just across the Damesneck lies Neckcliff, home of the imperial Admiralty. Another loyal Damerian vassal in times gone by, the lords of Neckcliff were as to the waves as we to the land. It is almost negligent of us to have neglected a faithful ally for so long, but their position isolated on the west dameshead - surrounded by the thorns of the rose - made them a poor choice for assisting with the usurper. Now that the Dove throne is restored to a worthy owner, it is time we move to bring the admirals back into the fold. To demonstrate our commitment to them, one of our own has suggested a grand project - the reconstruction of the Estádha, the elven arcship once captained by our founder, Istralania Warsinger. "

A45_prosperity_title: "Prosperity"
A45_prosperity_desc: "“Come ashore friend, you’re in the greatest country in the world now.” - unknown Anbenncóst dockworker.\n\nAs the inheritor of Dameria, Istralore shines as a beacon for Anbennar. A model of what a nation can be, of how a people can live, united in peace and faith. All the wealth of the world flows here to the dameshead, and it is to the envy of the world to be born a Damerian. Never let it be said that the Istralari are content to sit idly in their prosperity however. No, prosperity demands continuous effort, and constant improvement. Let us set our hand to booming industry, and put bread in the hand of every citizen!"

istralore.1.t: "Sparks of Hope"
istralore.1.d: "Duchess Aucanna was devastated; her grief threatened to overwhelm her. Adenn was dead, Dameria was gone, and traitors and fools ruled the Empire she called home. The defeat of the Damerian Moon Party was complete and resounding, and Aucanna couldn’t accept it. The others had moved on, and many had accepted the status quo as if the decades of honor and loyalty to Dameria had meant nothing. As if Adenn had meant nothing. She’d never stop hating them for it. The other princes in the Empire might bow and scrape before the Wexonard bastards as if they were the rightful rulers, but Aucanna would never forget the blood spilled to put them there. \n\nBut what could she do? To defy the Wexonards would spell the end of Istralore, the end of the Silistra line. Her people needed her, and so for them, she would keep her desire for vengeance in check. She needed strength to get back on her feet, she had been dragging herself along for too long. She needed to be strong like Corin had been, the hero who had so valiantly fought against the Greentide, and lost her life to bring its end. Corin had fought for what she believed; she had fought against evil and injustice, and Aucanna knew that was who she needed to be. She would get back up, she would fight, she would protect her people and the empire that Dameria had built. Dameria may be gone, but she was not. She would carry the memory of Dameria with her and guide her people with honor and strength. Corin-willing, perhaps Dameria could live again in Istralore. Aucanna could live with that."

istralore.39.d: "A wound could not stop Aucanna Silistra. If death did not halt Corin's war, she could fight past a scrape. Or a stab. Or a broken kneecap. She had done all of that and more when making a mockery of the Traitor's tournament, and she would do it again.\n\nAn illness could not stop Aucanna Silistra. Not when Anbennar was so deeply ill, with treachery and disloyalty. If she could not ride a horse, she could still write a letter; if she could not write a letter, she could still bark commands to assembled advisors. And she would, because that was her duty.\n\nChildbirth could not stop Aucanna Silistra. She reviewed the troops the day before she bore Aucan III, and she reviewed them the day afterwards. She spent the days her labour took for Marian drawing up a new defensive plan for the Dalemines, and duelled a novice bladedancer from Ibevar to a draw not one week after Alain was born. Losing the Lilac Wars and Dameria, that was something it would take years to recover -- childbirth would not.\n\nAll three of those things, though. Still, she hadn't faltered. Not until yesterday, at least..\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName] knows that even Corin leaned on allies, even [cool Damerian?] [stepped down or whatever]. And [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] knows it is time for [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother to sheathe her sword -- though not her intellect. And to start to cede the rule of [Root.GetName].\n\nAnd Aucanna?"
istralore.39.a: "She knows the same, but admitting it will be the struggle of a lifetime."

istralore.40.t: "Struggling On"
istralore.40.d: "Aucanna devoted her life to Istralore. Not just [Root.Capital.GetName], but the entire [Root.GovernmentName]. Reviewing the border guards. Tracing the flow of potential attacks, from or against her realm. Visiting returning adventurers from Escann to hear their stories of Corin. And countless other tasks, great and small, that took her from the castle in [Root.Capital.GetName] time and time again, to the point [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was half-raised by her letters.\n\nBut she will ride out no longer.\n\nAucanna taught the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that there is a tone a doctor uses, when they should be ignored in favour of duty. And there is a tone they use, when the alternative is death.\n\nThe words the doctor delivered today were soft, but undeniably the latter. Her latest bout of illness has passed, but could -- will -- relapse soon. And without specialized care, she would soon be dead.\n\nAucanna furrowed her brow to hear it, but nodded. Two hours later, she was on the training fields. She is still reviewing the troops, still sparring with Warsingers, still discussing planning with generals.\n\nAfter all, she learned at twenty what it is like to lose."
