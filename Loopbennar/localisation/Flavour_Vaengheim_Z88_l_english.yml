They are eager to help, to free the child from its shell, but they know that the first breach must be made by the child.\n\nWhen finally the shell cracks, a murmur of chittering excitement passes amidst the kobolds. A pinkish, fleshy, and stubby little hand pushes away at the shell and the sound of a baby's cry can be heard. Claws of many different colors greet the hand, pinching delicately at the now cracked shell and pulling it open to extract the newborn.\n\nIt’s a girl.\n\nIt’s a harpy.\n\nWhen her mother perished in a heroic battle against a Roc, it was a trivu of kobolds who had offered to care for the orphaned egg. She would be family, as any other egg hatched from the trivus nursery. A talon in two worlds, she would learn clever tricks and traps from her kobold siblings and in turn she would help teach the more sorcerously inclined among them to fly.\n\nSuch stories are common now, within the roosts of the Dragon Coast. As kobolds are welcomed within the homes of harpies, harpies are welcomed within the families of kobolds. Glittering hoards decorate the highest peaks, displayed proudly to any fliers above, while kobold traps protect roosts as fiercely as they might their own home. For, after all, many kobolds now call these roosts home."
